‚ùóÔ∏è _The abap2UI5 framework & apps can remain unchanged in your backend systems and will be accessed remotely_ ‚ùóÔ∏è
#### Technical Background
The project consists of a (generic) frontend UI5 app, which can be deployed to:
* SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform)
* ABAP Backend (S/4, R/3)

The abap2UI5 framework & apps are accessed through an OData Service, which can connect to:
* S/4 Public Cloud
* SAP BTP ABAP Environment
* S/4 and R/3 On-Premise (via Cloud Connector)

#### Installation
Follow these steps:
1. [Install the OData service with abapGit in the system where your abap2UI5 apps are running](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ext-service_integration/blob/main/docs/01_odata_installation.md)
2. [Setup your destination in SAP BTP](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ext-service_integration/blob/main/docs/02_destination_service_configuration.md)
3. [Deploy the UI5 app to your ABAP system or BTP](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ext-service_integration/blob/main/docs/03_app_deployment.md)
4. [Configure SAP Build Workzone](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ext-service_integration/blob/main/docs/04_build_workzone_configuration.md)
5. [Start your app with SAP Mobile Start](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ext-service_integration/blob/main/docs/05_mobile_start_configuration.md) (optional)
   
In on-premise scenario you can skip step (2)(4)(5) and instead:
* [Configure SAP Fiori Launchpad](https://github.com/abap2UI5/ext-service_integration/blob/main/docs/90_fiori_launchpad_configuration.md)
